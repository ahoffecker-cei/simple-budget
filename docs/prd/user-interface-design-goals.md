# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Simple Budget's interface embodies "reassuring financial companion" through clean, uncluttered design that prioritizes emotional comfort over comprehensive data display. The visual language uses encouraging colors (soft greens for "doing well", warm yellows for "pay attention", gentle oranges instead of alarming reds) with plenty of white space to reduce cognitive load. Every interaction reinforces the core message "I can handle this" through positive micro-interactions and confidence-building messaging rather than intimidating financial jargon.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Glance-and-Go Dashboard:** Primary information (budget status, account balances) visible without scrolling or clicking, supporting daily check-in habits
- **One-Touch Expense Logging:** Single-tap category selection with immediate visual feedback showing budget impact, designed for 15-second daily entries
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Advanced features hidden behind clean primary interface, revealed as users gain confidence and request more functionality
- **Encouraging Feedback Loops:** Every user action (expense logging, budget checking) provides positive reinforcement and clear next-step guidance

## Core Screens and Views
- **Main Dashboard:** Central hub displaying budget remaining, account balances, and financial health overview with dominant "Am I doing okay?" visual answer
- **Quick Expense Entry:** Streamlined logging interface with category auto-complete and immediate budget impact preview
- **Budget Setup Wizard:** Guided multi-step onboarding for income, expenses, and essential/non-essential categorization with encouraging progress indicators
- **Account Balance Management:** Simple interface for manually updating checking, savings, and retirement account totals with clear visual hierarchy
- **Category Management:** Essential vs. non-essential expense categorization with drag-and-drop simplicity and clear value explanations

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance ensures the financial confidence-building experience is available to users with disabilities, including high contrast modes, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and alternative text for all visual budget indicators.

## Branding
Clean, modern design language that feels more like a supportive life coach app than traditional financial software. Color palette emphasizes calming blues and encouraging greens with strategic use of warm accent colors. Typography prioritizes readability with friendly, approachable fonts that reduce the intimidation factor common in financial applications. Visual elements support the emotional positioning with subtle confidence-building icons and encouraging micro-animations.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Progressive Web App (PWA) optimized for mobile-first usage while maintaining full functionality on desktop and tablet. Responsive design ensures consistent experience across all devices without requiring app store downloads, reducing friction for target demographic who may be hesitant about financial app commitment.
