# Goals and Background Context

- Achieve 70% user setup completion and 60% monthly retention by providing emotional support over complex features

- Establish sustainable financial habits during the crucial first 1-3 years of financial independence

## Background Context

Simple Budget addresses a critical gap in the budgeting app market by focusing on the emotional journey of financial learning rather than treating budgeting as a purely analytical exercise. Fresh college graduates earning $30K-$50K with student loan obligations face simultaneous excitement about independence and stress about financial mistakes, yet existing solutions like Mint and YNAB overwhelm them with complexity when they need encouragement and simplicity.

The application targets the underserved market of financially anxious young adults during their most receptive window for developing positive financial behaviors. By answering the core question "Am I doing okay?" through visual clarity, essential vs. non-essential categorization, and confidence-building messaging, Simple Budget transforms budgeting from abandonment-prone complexity into engaging daily habits that build lifelong financial responsibility.
