# Story 2.4: Budget Overview Dashboard Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** my completed budget integrated into the main dashboard with visual status indicators and allocation bars,
**so that** I can see my budget plan, track spending allocation, and feel confident about my financial framework.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard displays all budget categories with allocated amounts and essential/non-essential indicators
2. Visual budget health overview showing total planned spending vs. income
3. "Budget Setup Complete" achievement messaging to build user confidence
4. Categories displayed in logical order (essential first, then non-essential)
5. Edit budget functionality accessible from dashboard without repeating full wizard
6. Budget data integration with existing account balance display from Epic 1
7. Loading performance maintains under 2-second requirement with budget data included
8. **Budget allocation bars showing how much of each category budget is allocated and remaining**

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: stories/2.3.essential-vs-non-essential-classification.md#dev-agent-record]
- Essential/non-essential classification system is fully operational with visual indicators
- Classification health display already exists in dashboard with progress bars (lines 237-276 in dashboard.component.ts)
- BudgetHealthByClassification interface provides essential vs. non-essential spending breakdown
- CategoryClassificationService provides classification health data via getClassificationHealth() method
- Dashboard already loads and displays classification health data with progress bars

### Technology Stack Details
[Source: architecture/technology-stack-table.md]
- **Frontend Framework**: Angular 15+ with TypeScript 5.0+ for dashboard budget integration
- **UI Component Library**: Angular Material 15+ with progress bars, cards, and visual indicator components
- **Backend Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8.0 with C# .NET 8 for dashboard data aggregation and budget calculations
- **Database**: SQL Server LocalDB with Entity Framework Core for budget and category data persistence
- **State Management**: Angular Services + RxJS for reactive budget data updates and dashboard state
- **Performance Requirement**: Sub-2-second dashboard load times including full budget data integration

### Data Models and API Integration
[Source: architecture/budgetcategory.md, architecture/rest-api-specification.md]
**Existing BudgetCategory Entity:**
- CategoryId: Guid - Primary identifier for budget categories
- UserId: Guid - User ownership and data isolation
- Name: string - Category display name for dashboard presentation
- MonthlyLimit: decimal - Budget allocation amount for progress bar calculations
- IsEssential: boolean - Essential vs. non-essential classification for visual grouping
- Description: string - Category guidance text for dashboard display
- CreatedAt: DateTime - Setup completion tracking

**Dashboard API Integration:**
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard` - Enhanced to include complete budget data with allocation calculations
- Dashboard response includes budgetCategories array with BudgetCategoryWithSpending objects
- Classification health data already available via ClassificationSuggestionService.getClassificationHealth()
- DashboardResponse schema supports overallHealthStatus and totalNetWorth integration

**Required New Interfaces for Allocation Bars Feature:**
The following interfaces need to be created to support the budget allocation bars functionality:
```typescript
export interface BudgetCategoryWithSpending {
  categoryId: string;
  name: string;
  monthlyLimit: number;
  currentSpending: number;
  isEssential: boolean;
  description?: string;
  allocationPercentage: number;
  remainingAmount: number;
  healthStatus: 'excellent' | 'good' | 'attention' | 'concern';
}

export interface BudgetOverviewData {
  totalBudgetAllocated: number;
  totalIncome: number;
  budgetHealthStatus: 'excellent' | 'good' | 'attention' | 'concern';
  isSetupComplete: boolean;
  allocationPercentage: number;
}
```

### Component Architecture and Integration Points
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md, existing dashboard.component.ts analysis]
**Current Dashboard Component Structure:**
- Dashboard component already exists at `/apps/web/src/app/components/dashboard.component.ts`
- Classification health section already implemented (lines 236-276) with progress bars
- DashboardService integration operational with getDashboard() method
- Existing financial health indicator system ready for budget health integration

**Required Component Enhancements:**
- Expand existing Monthly Budget section (lines 190-284) to show complete budget allocation overview
- Enhance budget category display to include allocation progress bars for each category
- Integrate with existing health indicator patterns and visual design system
- Add budget edit navigation without breaking existing account balance and classification workflows

**File Locations for Implementation:**
- Primary: `/apps/web/src/app/components/dashboard.component.ts` - Main dashboard integration
- Backend: `/apps/api/Controllers/DashboardController.cs` - Enhanced dashboard data endpoint
- Service: `/apps/web/src/app/services/dashboard.service.ts` - Dashboard data service updates
- Shared: `/shared/src/models/` - Enhanced interface definitions for budget integration

### Visual Design Integration
[Source: existing dashboard.component.ts styles analysis]
**Existing Design Patterns:**
- Progress bars already implemented for classification health (lines 1214-1228)
- Budget primary card styling established (lines 922-940) with confidence-building design
- Essential vs. non-essential visual indicators operational (lines 1106-1228)
- Material Design components and responsive grid layout system in place

**Budget Allocation Bars Implementation:**
- Follow existing progress bar patterns from classification health section
- Use established color scheme: essential categories (--color-success), non-essential (--color-accent)
- Integrate with existing card-based layout and visual hierarchy
- Maintain confidence-building design language with encouraging messaging

**Responsive Design Requirements:**
- Budget allocation bars must display appropriately on mobile devices (320px+ width)
- On tablets and mobile, stack category cards vertically with full-width progress bars
- Allocation percentages and amounts should remain readable on small screens
- Touch-friendly "Edit Budget" buttons with minimum 44px touch target size
- Progress bars maintain minimum 8px height for accessibility and touch interaction

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/technology-stack-table.md#authentication, budgetcategory.md]
**Financial Data Protection:**
- All budget data API calls must enforce user isolation via UserId validation
- Budget amounts and allocation data should not be logged in application logs
- Dashboard API responses must include only the authenticated user's budget data
- Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing financial data in error messages
- All budget calculations performed server-side to prevent client-side manipulation
- Use HTTPS for all budget data transmission (enforced by ASP.NET Core configuration)

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/technology-stack-table.md#testing]
**Testing Requirements:**
- **Unit Testing**: Jest + Angular Testing Utilities for dashboard.component.spec.ts
- **Backend Testing**: xUnit + ASP.NET Test Host for DashboardController tests
- **Test Location**: `/apps/web/src/app/components/dashboard.component.spec.ts`
- **API Test Location**: `/apps/api/Tests/Controllers/DashboardControllerTests.cs`
- **Testing Focus**: Budget allocation calculations, visual component rendering, performance validation
- **Performance Testing**: Validate sub-2-second dashboard load times with full budget data
- **Security Testing**: Verify user isolation and proper budget data access controls
