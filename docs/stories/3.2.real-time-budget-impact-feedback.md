### Real-Time Budget Impact Workflow
[Source: architecture/daily-expense-logging-workflow.md]
**Enhanced User Interaction Flow:**
1. User enters expense amount and selects category in expense logging form
2. Real-time budget impact preview triggers as user types amount
3. Budget impact preview API called with categoryId and amount for immediate calculation
4. Visual health indicators (green/yellow/red) display budget remaining after expense
5. Essential vs non-essential category status influences visual feedback priority and messaging
6. Encouraging messaging displays based on budget adherence level
7. Monthly progress bars update to show category spending levels in real-time
8. User sees budget impact before confirming expense entry
9. Upon confirmation, expense creation includes immediate budget health recalculation
10. Dashboard updates in real-time with new budget status and health indicators

**Visual Feedback States:**
- **Excellent**: Green indicators with celebratory messaging for good budget adherence
- **Good**: Light green indicators with encouraging messaging for healthy spending
- **Attention**: Yellow indicators with gentle guidance for approaching limits
- **Concern**: Red indicators with supportive messaging for budget overruns

### Visual Design & User Experience
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#financial-health-indicator]
**Real-Time Feedback Design Principles:**
- Immediate visual feedback reducing anxiety about spending decisions
- Confidence-building color scheme with encouraging green/blue accents for good spending
- Gentle warning system using yellow/orange for attention states
- Supportive messaging for budget concerns using warm, non-judgmental language
- Smooth animations for state transitions to reduce jarring feedback changes
- Essential category visual priority using established shield icons and prominent placement

**Encouraging Messaging System:**
- **Celebration**: "Great choice! You're staying well within your budget!" (Excellent state)
- **Encouragement**: "Looking good! You have plenty of room in this category." (Good state)
- **Guidance**: "This will put you close to your limit. You've got this!" (Attention state)
- **Support**: "This goes over your budget, but that's okay! Let's adjust together." (Concern state)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/technology-stack-table.md, architecture/daily-expense-logging-workflow.md]
- **Real-Time Performance**: Sub-500ms response times for budget impact preview calculations
- **Caching Strategy**: In-Memory Cache for frequently accessed budget calculations with detailed implementation:
  - **Cache Keys**: 
    - Budget Impact Preview: `budget_impact_{userId}_{categoryId}_{amount}_{month}`
    - Overall Budget Health: `budget_health_{userId}_{month}`
    - Monthly Progress Data: `monthly_progress_{userId}_{month}`
    - Category Totals: `category_spent_{userId}_{categoryId}_{month}`
  - **Cache Expiration Policies**:
    - Budget Impact Preview: 5 minutes (frequent updates expected)
    - Overall Budget Health: 10 minutes (less frequent changes)
    - Monthly Progress Data: 10 minutes (updated with new expenses)
    - Category Totals: 15 minutes (foundational data, changes less frequently)
  - **Cache Invalidation Strategy**:
    - Invalidate user's budget cache on expense creation/update/deletion
    - Invalidate category-specific cache when category limits are modified
    - Invalidate monthly cache on month boundary transitions
    - Implement cache warming for frequently accessed user data during low-traffic periods
  - **Cache Performance Requirements**:
    - Cache hit rate >90% for repeated budget calculations
    - Memory usage <100MB for 1000 concurrent users
    - Cache operations <5ms response time
- **Data Consistency**: Budget calculations must reflect accurate real-time expense totals
- **Security**: All budget endpoints protected by JWT authentication with user data isolation
  - **Input Validation Requirements**:
    - CategoryId: Must be valid GUID format and belong to authenticated user
    - Amount: Must be positive decimal, maximum 2 decimal places, range $0.01-$999,999.99
    - ExpenseDate: Must be valid date, not more than 1 year in past or future
  - **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per minute per user for preview endpoints
  - **User Data Isolation**: All budget calculations filtered by JWT userId claim
- **Memory Management**: Efficient Angular component lifecycle for real-time update subscriptions
- **Network Optimization**: Debounced API calls for real-time preview to prevent excessive requests (300ms debounce delay)
