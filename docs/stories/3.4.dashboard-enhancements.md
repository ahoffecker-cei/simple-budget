3. Income section displays total monthly income with clickable link to management modal
4. Savings Progress section displays all savings goals with current progress and target amounts
5. Budget categories section shows real-time spending with immediate updates after expense logging
6. Recent expenses section displays last 10 expenses with real-time updates and category information
7. User can click income amount to open income management modal for multiple income source setup
8. User can log expenses with optional savings goal tagging for contributions vs. spending
9. All dashboard sections update in real-time without page refresh for seamless experience
10. Savings goal progress updates immediately when tagged expenses are logged

**Income Management Workflow:**
1. User clicks income amount on dashboard
2. Income management modal opens with current income sources displayed
3. User can add multiple income sources with name, amount, and frequency
4. Modal calculates and displays total monthly income from all sources
5. User saves changes and dashboard income updates immediately
6. Modal provides validation for amounts and required fields

**Savings Goal Workflow:**
1. User creates savings goals with name and target amount
2. Savings goals display in dedicated dashboard section with progress bars
3. User logs expenses and optionally tags them as savings contributions
4. Tagged expenses add to savings goal progress instead of deducting from budget
5. Savings goal progress updates in real-time with encouraging visual indicators

  - **Cache Invalidation Enhancement**:
    - Invalidate income cache on income source creation/update/deletion
    - Invalidate savings goal cache on goal modification or contribution logging
    - Invalidate enhanced dashboard cache on any income, savings, or expense changes
- **Mobile Performance**: Optimized component loading and modal interactions for mobile devices
