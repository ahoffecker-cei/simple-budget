**Shared Component Integration:**
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#financial-health-indicator]
- Enhance existing financial-health-indicator component for post-expense budget health display
- Update budget-category-card component to show spending against limits with new expense impact
- Apply established confidence-building design patterns with encouraging expense logging messaging

### Expense Logging Workflow
[Source: architecture/daily-expense-logging-workflow.md]
**User Interaction Flow:**
1. User taps "Add Expense" button from dashboard or navigation
2. Expense entry form displays with amount field, category dropdown, optional description
3. Category dropdown populated from user's existing budget categories with auto-complete
4. Date picker defaults to today with option to backdate recent expenses
5. Real-time budget impact preview shows remaining budget as user types amount
6. Visual indicators (green/yellow/red) show budget health impact before confirmation
7. User confirms expense entry
8. API creates expense with sub-500ms response time including budget calculations
9. Success feedback displays with updated budget health status
10. Dashboard updates in real-time to reflect new expense and budget impact

**Offline Support Requirements:**
- Store expense entries in IndexedDB when offline
- Display "Saved offline" message with distinctive styling
- Background sync uploads offline expenses when connection restored
- Visual indicators show sync status for offline-created expenses

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `apps/api/Controllers/ExpensesController.cs`
- **Change**: Removed debug Console.WriteLine statements on lines 70 and 75
- **Why**: Debug logging statements should not exist in production code and violate clean code principles
- **How**: Improves code cleanliness and prevents potential logging noise in production environments

**File**: `apps/api/Tests/Controllers/ExpensesControllerTests.cs`  
- **Change**: Fixed UserManager dependency injection and mocking setup
- **Why**: Original implementation had incorrect constructor parameters and missing UserManager mock setup
- **How**: Properly configures UserManager<ApplicationUser> mock with IUserStore dependency, enabling tests to run correctly

- **Change**: Updated test assertions to match actual API response types
- **Why**: Tests were referencing non-existent response types and incorrect assertion patterns
- **How**: Changed from OkObjectResult to CreatedAtActionResult and updated property assertions to match ExpenseWithBudgetImpact structure

- **Change**: Corrected user entity type from User to ApplicationUser
- **Why**: Tests were using incorrect entity type that doesn't match the actual Identity framework implementation
- **How**: Updated to use ApplicationUser consistently with proper Identity framework conventions

### Compliance Check

- [ ] Consider adding integration tests for complete expense workflow end-to-end
- [ ] Consider extracting budget calculation logic to separate service class for better testability
- [ ] Consider adding API documentation comments for OpenAPI/Swagger generation

### Security Review

**Security Assessment**: ✓ **Excellent**
- All endpoints properly secured with [Authorize] attribute
- User data isolation correctly implemented in all database queries
- Input validation properly implemented with data annotations
- No sensitive information exposed in responses or logs
- JWT authentication correctly integrated with user context
