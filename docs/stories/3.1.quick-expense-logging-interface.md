- Amount: decimal - Expense amount with precision for financial calculations
- Description: string - Optional expense details for user reference
- ExpenseDate: DateTime - When expense occurred (supports backdating for recent expenses)
- CreatedAt: DateTime - Audit trail for expense logging tracking

**TypeScript Interfaces Required:**
```typescript
export interface Expense {
  expenseId: string;

    ├── expense-entry-form/               # Reusable expense form component
    └── expense-success-feedback/         # Visual confirmation component
```

**Shared Component Integration:**
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#financial-health-indicator]
- Enhance existing financial-health-indicator component for post-expense budget health display
- Update budget-category-card component to show spending against limits with new expense impact
- Apply established confidence-building design patterns with encouraging expense logging messaging

### Expense Logging Workflow
[Source: architecture/daily-expense-logging-workflow.md]
**User Interaction Flow:**
1. User taps "Add Expense" button from dashboard or navigation
2. Expense entry form displays with amount field, category dropdown, optional description
3. Category dropdown populated from user's existing budget categories with auto-complete
4. Date picker defaults to today with option to backdate recent expenses
5. Real-time budget impact preview shows remaining budget as user types amount
6. Visual indicators (green/yellow/red) show budget health impact before confirmation
7. User confirms expense entry
8. API creates expense with sub-500ms response time including budget calculations
9. Success feedback displays with updated budget health status
10. Dashboard updates in real-time to reflect new expense and budget impact

**Offline Support Requirements:**
- Store expense entries in IndexedDB when offline
- Display "Saved offline" message with distinctive styling
- Background sync uploads offline expenses when connection restored
- Visual indicators show sync status for offline-created expenses
