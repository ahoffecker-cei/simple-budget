- User management with ASP.NET Identity is established and working
- Shared TypeScript interfaces in `/shared/src/models/` are set up and functional
- Angular authentication service and guards are protecting routes appropriately

### Technology Stack Details
[Source: architecture/technology-stack-table.md]
- **Frontend Framework**: Angular 15+ with TypeScript 5.0+ for type-safe development
- **UI Component Library**: Angular Material 15+ as foundation, heavily customized for confidence-building aesthetic
- **Backend Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8.0 with C# .NET 8 for high-performance API development
- **Database**: SQL Server LocalDB for development, SQL Server 2022 for production
- **State Management**: Angular Services + RxJS for reactive state management (no NgRx for MVP scope)
- **Testing**: xUnit + ASP.NET Test Host (backend), Jest + Angular Testing Utilities (frontend)
- **Performance Requirement**: Sub-500ms response times for all API endpoints

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/account.md]
**Account Entity Attributes:**
- AccountId: Guid - Primary identifier
- UserId: Guid - Owner reference (foreign key to User)
- AccountType: enum - Checking, Savings, Retirement
- AccountName: string - User-defined account name for personalization
- CurrentBalance: decimal - Manually entered balance amount
- LastUpdated: DateTime - Balance update tracking timestamp

**TypeScript Interface:**
```typescript
export enum AccountType {
  Checking = 'checking',
  Savings = 'savings',
  Retirement = 'retirement'
}

export interface Account {
  accountId: string;
  userId: string;
  accountType: AccountType;
  accountName: string;
  currentBalance: number;
  lastUpdated: string;
}
```

**Database Relationships:**
- Many-to-one with User (each account belongs to one user)

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/rest-api-specification.md]
**Base URLs:**
- Development: https://localhost:5001/api/v1
- Production: https://simplebudget-api.azurewebsites.net/api/v1

**Dashboard Endpoint:**
- `GET /dashboard` - Returns complete dashboard data for authenticated user

**Accounts Endpoint:**
- `GET /accounts` - Returns all user accounts with current balances

**DashboardResponse Schema:**
```typescript
{
  overallHealthStatus: 'excellent' | 'good' | 'attention' | 'concern',
  totalNetWorth: number,
  accounts: Account[],
  budgetCategories: BudgetCategoryWithSpending[],
  recentExpenses: ExpenseWithBudgetImpact[]
}
```

**Account Schema:**
```typescript
{
  accountId: string (uuid),
  userId: string (uuid),
  accountType: 'checking' | 'savings' | 'retirement',
  accountName: string,
  currentBalance: number,
  lastUpdated: string (date-time)
}
```

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md, architecture/angular-frontend-components.md]
**Angular Component Organization:**
- Dashboard component should be created in `/apps/web/src/app/features/dashboard/`
- Reusable components like account balance cards in `/apps/web/src/app/shared/components/`
- Services for API communication in `/apps/web/src/app/core/services/`

**Component Responsibilities:**
- Dashboard displays "Am I doing okay?" status with visual confidence builders
- Account balance management with encouraging user interface design
- Real-time balance updates with immediate visual feedback

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/repository-structure.md]
**Backend Files:**
- `/apps/api/Controllers/` - AccountsController and DashboardController
- `/apps/api/Models/` - Account.cs entity model
- `/apps/api/Data/` - ApplicationDbContext updates for Account DbSet
- `/apps/api.Tests/Controllers/` - Unit tests for controllers

**Frontend Files:**
- `/apps/web/src/app/features/dashboard/` - Dashboard component and related files
- `/apps/web/src/app/shared/components/` - Reusable account balance components
- `/apps/web/src/app/core/services/` - API services for dashboard and accounts
- `/shared/src/models/` - TypeScript interfaces for Account and Dashboard models

### UI Design Requirements
[Source: prd/user-interface-design-goals.md]
**Visual Design Principles:**
- Encouraging colors: soft greens for "doing well", warm yellows for "pay attention"
- Calming blues and encouraging greens as primary palette
- Clean, uncluttered design with plenty of white space to reduce cognitive load
- Glance-and-go dashboard with primary information visible without scrolling
- Progressive disclosure with advanced features hidden behind clean primary interface

**Core Dashboard Requirements:**
- Main Dashboard as central hub displaying account balances and financial health
- Dominant "Am I doing okay?" visual answer through overall health status
- Account Balance Management with simple interface for manual balance updates
- Clear visual hierarchy supporting emotional comfort over comprehensive data display

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/technology-stack-table.md, architecture/aspnet-core-api-layer.md]
- **Response Time**: Sub-500ms response times required for dashboard endpoint (NFR1)
- **Cross-platform**: Must work on Windows, Mac, and Linux development environments
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first PWA optimized for all devices (NFR4)
- **Security**: All financial data protected by JWT authentication guards
- **Performance**: Dashboard must load in under 2 seconds as specified in NFR1

### Project Structure Alignment
Dashboard implementation aligns with established monorepo structure:
- **API Layer**: Controllers in `/apps/api/Controllers/` for data endpoints
- **Data Layer**: Entity Framework integration in `/apps/api/Data/` for Account persistence
- **UI Layer**: Angular dashboard components in `/apps/web/src/app/features/dashboard/`
- **Shared Layer**: TypeScript interfaces in `/shared/src/models/` for type consistency

### Testing
[Source: architecture/technology-stack-table.md]
**Testing Standards:**
- **Backend Testing**: xUnit + ASP.NET Test Host for AccountsController and DashboardController
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest + Angular Testing Utilities for dashboard component and services
- **Test Location**: Backend tests in `/apps/api.Tests/Controllers/`, frontend tests co-located with `.spec.ts` naming
- **Dashboard-Specific Testing**: Must test account balance calculations, API response times, and responsive design functionality
