# Story 1.2: User Authentication System

## Status
Approved - Completed with Enhancements

## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** secure account creation and login functionality,
**so that** my financial data is protected and I can access it consistently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User registration form collects email and secure password with validation
2. Login system authenticates users with JWT token-based sessions
3. Password requirements enforce security standards (8+ characters, mixed case, numbers)
4. JWT tokens expire appropriately and refresh automatically during active sessions
5. Logout functionality clears authentication tokens completely
6. Database stores user credentials with proper password hashing (bcrypt or equivalent)
7. Authentication guards protect all financial data routes

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: stories/1.1.project-setup-development-environment.md#dev-agent-record]
- Monorepo structure with shared TypeScript interfaces is already established
- ASP.NET Identity dependencies need to be added to existing project
- Entity Framework Core 9 and ApplicationDbContext are configured and ready for extension
- JWT token authentication infrastructure needs to be added to existing ASP.NET Core setup

### Technology Stack Details
[Source: architecture/technology-stack-table.md]
- **Authentication**: JWT + ASP.NET Identity (ASP.NET Built-in) - Stateless, scalable, integrates with Angular guards
- **Backend Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8.0 with C# .NET 8
- **Database**: SQL Server LocalDB for development, SQL Server 2022 for production
- **Frontend Framework**: Angular 15+ with TypeScript 5.0+
- **Testing**: xUnit + ASP.NET Test Host (backend), Jest + Angular Testing Utilities (frontend)

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/user.md]
**User Entity Attributes:**
- UserId: Guid - Primary identifier  
- Email: string - Authentication and communication
- PasswordHash: string - Secure credential storage (handled by ASP.NET Identity)
- FirstName: string - Personalization for confidence-building messaging
- MonthlyIncome: decimal - Foundation for budget calculations  
- StudentLoanPayment: decimal - Critical expense for target demographic
- StudentLoanBalance: decimal - Total remaining debt tracking
- CreatedAt: DateTime - Account creation timestamp
- LastLoginAt: DateTime - Engagement tracking

**User TypeScript Interface:**
```typescript
export interface User {
  userId: string;
  email: string;
  firstName: string;
  monthlyIncome: number;
  studentLoanPayment: number;
  studentLoanBalance: number;
  createdAt: string;
  lastLoginAt: string;
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/rest-api-specification.md#authentication-endpoints]
**Base URLs:**
- Development: https://localhost:5001/api/v1  
- Production: https://simplebudget-api.azurewebsites.net/api/v1

**Authentication Endpoints:**
- `POST /auth/register` - Register new user account
- `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate user and return JWT token

**RegisterRequest Schema:**
```typescript
{
  email: string (format: email, required),
  password: string (minLength: 8, required), 
  firstName: string (required),
  monthlyIncome: number (minimum: 1000, maximum: 200000, required)
}
```

**AuthResponse Schema:**
```typescript  
{
  token: string,
  user: User,
  expiresAt: string (format: date-time)
}
```

**Error Response Schema:**
```typescript
{
  error: {
    code: string,
    message: string, 
    timestamp: string (format: date-time),
    requestId: string
  }
}
```

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/aspnet-core-api-layer.md]
**ASP.NET Core API Layer Responsibilities:**
- Authentication endpoints (register, login, JWT token management)
- Sub-500ms response times requirement
- Integration with ASP.NET Identity for secure credential management
- Azure Application Insights integration for monitoring

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/repository-structure.md]
**Backend Files Location:**
- `/apps/api/` - ASP.NET Core backend directory
- `/apps/api/Controllers/` - API controllers including AuthController
- `/apps/api/Data/` - Entity Framework DbContext and configurations
- `/apps/api/Models/` - C# model classes including User
- `/apps/api.Tests/` - xUnit test project

**Frontend Files Location:**  
- `/apps/web/src/app/` - Angular application directory
- `/apps/web/src/app/services/` - Angular services including AuthService
- `/apps/web/src/app/guards/` - Angular guards for route protection
- `/apps/web/src/app/components/` - Authentication form components
- `/shared/src/models/` - TypeScript interfaces including User interface

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/technology-stack-table.md, architecture/aspnet-core-api-layer.md]
- **Response Time**: Sub-500ms response times for authentication endpoints
- **Security**: Proper password hashing using ASP.NET Identity (bcrypt equivalent)
- **JWT Configuration**: Stateless tokens with appropriate expiration
- **Cross-platform**: Must work on Windows, Mac, and Linux development environments

### Project Structure Alignment Notes
Authentication system aligns with established monorepo structure:
- **API Layer**: ASP.NET Core controllers in `/apps/api/Controllers/`
- **Data Layer**: Entity Framework integration in `/apps/api/Data/`  
- **UI Layer**: Angular authentication components in `/apps/web/src/app/`
- **Shared Layer**: TypeScript interfaces in `/shared/src/models/`

### Testing
[Source: architecture/technology-stack-table.md]
**Testing Standards:**
- **Backend Testing**: xUnit + ASP.NET Test Host for API and authentication logic testing
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest + Angular Testing Utilities for component and service testing  
- **Test Location**: Tests should be co-located with source files using `.spec.ts` (frontend) and `.Tests.cs` (backend) naming conventions
- **Authentication-Specific Testing**: Must test password validation, JWT token generation/validation, and route protection
