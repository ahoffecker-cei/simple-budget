## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: stories/2.1.budget-setup-wizard-income-basic-info.md#dev-agent-record]
- Budget wizard foundation with monthlyIncome field is established in User entity
- BudgetWizardController with budget health calculation logic is operational
- Angular Material stepper components and confidence-building aesthetic are implemented
- JWT authentication and user profile management fully functional
- Shared TypeScript interfaces in `/shared/src/models/` are working and integrated

### Technology Stack Details
[Source: architecture/technology-stack-table.md]
- **Frontend Framework**: Angular 15+ with TypeScript 5.0+ for budget category management interface
- **UI Component Library**: Angular Material 15+ with dialog components for category creation/editing
- **Backend Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8.0 with C# .NET 8 for BudgetCategories API endpoints
- **Database**: SQL Server LocalDB for development, Entity Framework Core for BudgetCategory persistence
- **State Management**: Angular Services + RxJS for category data management and real-time calculations
- **Validation**: Angular Reactive Forms with custom validators for spending limits and budget totals
- **Performance Requirement**: Sub-500ms response times for category CRUD operations

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/budgetcategory.md, architecture/user.md]
**BudgetCategory Entity Required:**
- CategoryId: Guid - Primary identifier for database relationships
- UserId: Guid - Owner reference linking to authenticated user
- Name: string - Category display name (e.g., "Groceries", "Entertainment")
- MonthlyLimit: decimal - Planned spending amount for budget calculations
- IsEssential: boolean - Essential vs non-essential classification (for future stories)
- Description: string - Helpful guidance text for user understanding
- CreatedAt: DateTime - Setup tracking and audit trail

**TypeScript Interface:**
```typescript
export interface BudgetCategory {
  categoryId: string;
  userId: string;
  name: string;
  monthlyLimit: number;
  isEssential: boolean;
  description?: string;
  createdAt: string;
}

export interface CreateBudgetCategoryRequest {
  name: string;
  monthlyLimit: number;
  isEssential: boolean;
  description?: string;
}

export interface BudgetCategoryWithSpending {
  categoryId: string;
  name: string;
  monthlyLimit: number;
  isEssential: boolean;
  description?: string;
  currentSpending: number;
  remainingBudget: number;
}
```

**Database Relationships:**
[Source: architecture/budgetcategory.md#relationships]
- Many-to-one with User (category belongs to authenticated user)
- One-to-many with Expense (category will contain multiple expenses in future stories)
- Foreign key constraint on UserId ensures data isolation between users

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/rest-api-specification.md]
**Base URLs:**
- Development: https://localhost:5001/api/v1
- Production: https://simplebudget-api.azurewebsites.net/api/v1

**BudgetCategories Endpoints:**
- `GET /budget-categories` - Retrieve all user's budget categories with optional spending data
- `POST /budget-categories` - Create new budget category with validation
- `PUT /budget-categories/{id}` - Update existing category (name, limit, description)
- `DELETE /budget-categories/{id}` - Remove category with safety checks

**Request/Response Schemas:**
[Source: architecture/rest-api-specification.md#components]
- All endpoints require JWT Bearer authentication
- POST/PUT requests validate monthlyLimit against user's monthlyIncome
- GET responses include calculated currentSpending and remainingBudget fields
- Error responses follow standardized ErrorResponse schema with helpful messaging

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md, architecture/angular-frontend-components.md]
**Angular Component Organization:**
- Budget category management components in `/apps/web/src/app/features/budget-setup/`
- Reusable budget-category-card component in `/apps/web/src/app/shared/components/`
- Category creation/edit dialog components for modal workflows

**Component Structure:**
```
budget-setup/
├── budget-categories.component.ts          # Main category management interface
├── budget-categories.component.html        # Category display with groupings
├── budget-categories.component.scss        # Confidence-building styling
├── dialogs/
│   ├── add-category-dialog.component.ts    # Category creation modal
│   └── edit-category-dialog.component.ts   # Category editing modal
└── services/
    └── budget-categories.service.ts        # API communication and state management
```

**Shared Component Integration:**
- Use existing financial-health-indicator component for budget total feedback
- Integrate with progress-indicator component for visual budget allocation
- Apply established confidence-building design patterns from Story 2.1

### Budget Validation Logic
[Source: architecture/user.md, previous story context]
**Income-Based Validation:**
- User.MonthlyIncome field established in Story 2.1 provides validation foundation
- Budget total calculation: Sum of all BudgetCategory.MonthlyLimit values
- Client-side validation prevents form submission if total exceeds income
- Server-side validation ensures data integrity with helpful error messaging

**Pre-populated Category Defaults:**
```typescript
const DEFAULT_CATEGORIES = [
  { name: 'Groceries', isEssential: true, description: 'Food and household essentials' },
  { name: 'Transportation', isEssential: true, description: 'Gas, public transit, car payments' },
  { name: 'Utilities', isEssential: true, description: 'Electricity, water, internet, phone' },
  { name: 'Entertainment', isEssential: false, description: 'Movies, games, hobbies' },
  { name: 'Dining Out', isEssential: false, description: 'Restaurants and takeout' }
];
```
