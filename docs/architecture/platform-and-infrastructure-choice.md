# Platform and Infrastructure Choice

Based on your PRD requirements and $500/month budget constraint, I recommend **Azure as the primary platform**:

**Option 1: Azure Full Stack (Recommended)**
- **Pros:** Seamless .NET integration, managed SQL Database, integrated monitoring, cost-effective for small scale, excellent CI/CD integration
- **Cons:** Microsoft ecosystem lock-in, learning curve for Azure services
- **Monthly Cost:** ~$200-400 within budget

**Recommendation: Azure Full Stack** - Best alignment with your .NET expertise and integrated tooling.

**Platform:** Azure
**Key Services:** App Service (frontend/backend), SQL Database, Application Insights, Azure DevOps
**Deployment Host and Regions:** East US (primary), Central US (backup)
