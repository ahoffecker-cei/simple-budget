# Starter Template Assessment

Based on your PRD technical assumptions, this is a **greenfield project** with specific Angular/.NET Core requirements rather than using existing starter templates. Your technology stack choices (Angular 15+, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, Azure) are already clearly defined, making starter templates unnecessary.

However, I recommend considering:
- **Angular PWA starter** for service worker setup
- **Azure DevOps templates** for CI/CD pipeline configuration
- **.NET Web API template** as base project structure

**Decision:** Proceed with greenfield development using your defined tech stack.
