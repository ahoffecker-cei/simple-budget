# Simple Budget Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Empower young adults (22-28) to transition from financial anxiety to financial confidence through reassuring budgeting tools
- Transform overwhelming financial management into an empowering "I can handle this" journey for fresh college graduates  
- Achieve 70% user setup completion and 60% monthly retention by providing emotional support over complex features
- Enable users to build emergency savings while managing student debt through predictive guidance and visual clarity
- Establish sustainable financial habits during the crucial first 1-3 years of financial independence

### Background Context

Simple Budget addresses a critical gap in the budgeting app market by focusing on the emotional journey of financial learning rather than treating budgeting as a purely analytical exercise. Fresh college graduates earning $30K-$50K with student loan obligations face simultaneous excitement about independence and stress about financial mistakes, yet existing solutions like Mint and YNAB overwhelm them with complexity when they need encouragement and simplicity.

The application targets the underserved market of financially anxious young adults during their most receptive window for developing positive financial behaviors. By answering the core question "Am I doing okay?" through visual clarity, essential vs. non-essential categorization, and confidence-building messaging, Simple Budget transforms budgeting from abandonment-prone complexity into engaging daily habits that build lifelong financial responsibility.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Simple Budget's interface embodies "reassuring financial companion" through clean, uncluttered design that prioritizes emotional comfort over comprehensive data display. The visual language uses encouraging colors (soft greens for "doing well", warm yellows for "pay attention", gentle oranges instead of alarming reds) with plenty of white space to reduce cognitive load. Every interaction reinforces the core message "I can handle this" through positive micro-interactions and confidence-building messaging rather than intimidating financial jargon.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Glance-and-Go Dashboard:** Primary information (budget status, account balances) visible without scrolling or clicking, supporting daily check-in habits
- **One-Touch Expense Logging:** Single-tap category selection with immediate visual feedback showing budget impact, designed for 15-second daily entries
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Advanced features hidden behind clean primary interface, revealed as users gain confidence and request more functionality
- **Encouraging Feedback Loops:** Every user action (expense logging, budget checking) provides positive reinforcement and clear next-step guidance

### Core Screens and Views
- **Main Dashboard:** Central hub displaying budget remaining, account balances, and financial health overview with dominant "Am I doing okay?" visual answer
- **Quick Expense Entry:** Streamlined logging interface with category auto-complete and immediate budget impact preview
- **Budget Setup Wizard:** Guided multi-step onboarding for income, expenses, and essential/non-essential categorization with encouraging progress indicators
- **Account Balance Management:** Simple interface for manually updating checking, savings, and retirement account totals with clear visual hierarchy
- **Category Management:** Essential vs. non-essential expense categorization with drag-and-drop simplicity and clear value explanations

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance ensures the financial confidence-building experience is available to users with disabilities, including high contrast modes, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and alternative text for all visual budget indicators.

### Branding
Clean, modern design language that feels more like a supportive life coach app than traditional financial software. Color palette emphasizes calming blues and encouraging greens with strategic use of warm accent colors. Typography prioritizes readability with friendly, approachable fonts that reduce the intimidation factor common in financial applications. Visual elements support the emotional positioning with subtle confidence-building icons and encouraging micro-animations.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Progressive Web App (PWA) optimized for mobile-first usage while maintaining full functionality on desktop and tablet. Responsive design ensures consistent experience across all devices without requiring app store downloads, reducing friction for target demographic who may be hesitant about financial app commitment.
